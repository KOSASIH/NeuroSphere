Technical Guide
===============

Overview
--------

This technical guide provides an in-depth look at the architecture and implementation of our system. It is intended for developers and technical stakeholders who want to understand the inner workings of our system.

System Architecture
-----------------

Our system consists of the following components:

* **Node**: The node is the core component of our system. It is responsible for executing tasks and communicating with other nodes.
* **Network**: The network is the communication layer that connects nodes together. It is responsible for routing messages between nodes.
* **Database**: The database is the storage layer that stores data for our system. It is responsible for persisting data and providing data access to nodes.

Node Architecture
----------------

The node architecture consists of the following components:

* **Task Executor**: The task executor is responsible for executing tasks on the node. It receives tasks from the network and executes them using the node's resources.
* **Network Interface**: The network interface is responsible for communicating with other nodes on the network. It sends and receives messages using the network protocol.
* **Database Interface**: The database interface is responsible for accessing data from the database. It provides data access to the task executor and other components.

Network Protocol
----------------

Our network protocol is based on TCP/IP and uses JSON-encoded messages to communicate between nodes. The protocol consists of the following messages:

* **Task Request**: A task request message is sent from one node to another to request the execution of a task.
* **Task Response**: A task response message is sent from a node to another node to respond to a task request.
* **Data Request**: A data request message is sent from one node to another to request data from the database.
* **Data Response**: A data response message is sent from a node to another node to respond to a data request.

Database Schema
----------------

Our database schema consists of the following tables:

* **Tasks**: The tasks table stores information about tasks, including the task ID, task type, and task status.
* **Data**: The data table stores data for our system, including task results and other metadata.

Security
--------

Our system uses the following security measures to protect data and ensure integrity:

* **Encryption**: Data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption to protect it from unauthorized access.
* **Authentication**: Nodes authenticate with each other using public-key cryptography to ensure that only authorized nodes can communicate with each other.
* **Access Control**: Access control lists (ACLs) are used to restrict access to data and tasks based on node roles and permissions.

Conclusion
----------

This technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of our system's architecture and implementation. It is intended to serve as a reference for developers and technical stakeholders who want to understand the inner workings of our system.
