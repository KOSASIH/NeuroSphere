NeuroSphere
==========

Welcome to NeuroSphere, an open-source platform for building and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models for IoT devices.

Overview
--------

NeuroSphere is a Python-based platform that enables developers to create, train, and deploy AI/ML models on IoT devices. The platform provides a simple and intuitive API for building and deploying models, as well as a range of tools and libraries for data processing, model training, and model deployment.

Features
--------

* **Model Building**: NeuroSphere provides a range of tools and libraries for building AI/ML models, including support for popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
* **Model Training**: NeuroSphere provides a range of tools and libraries for training AI/ML models, including support for distributed training and hyperparameter tuning.
* **Model Deployment**: NeuroSphere provides a range of tools and libraries for deploying AI/ML models on IoT devices, including support for edge computing and real-time inference.
* **Data Processing**: NeuroSphere provides a range of tools and libraries for processing and analyzing data from IoT devices, including support for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data visualization.

Getting Started
--------------

To get started with NeuroSphere, follow these steps:

1. **Install NeuroSphere**: Install NeuroSphere using pip: `pip install neurosphere`
